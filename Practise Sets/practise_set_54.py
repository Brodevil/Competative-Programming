# Solution :


#!/bin/python3

# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER_ARRAY a
#  2. INTEGER_ARRAY b

from functools import reduce
from fractions import gcd



def getTotalX(a: list, b: list):
    # Write your code here
    lcm_a = reduce(lambda x,y: x*y//gcd(x,y), a)
    gcd_b = reduce(gcd, b)
    return (sum(1 for x in range(lcm_a,gcd_b+1,lcm_a) if gcd_b%x==0))
