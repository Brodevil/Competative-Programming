if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    first_multiple_input = input().rstrip().split()

    n = int(first_multiple_input[0])

    k = int(first_multiple_input[1])

    height = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))

    result = hurdleRace(k, height)

    print(result)
