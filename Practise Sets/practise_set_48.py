Time Conversion | Problem Statement :


Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, 
convert it to military (24-hour) time.


Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
      - 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.



Example :
    - s = "12:001:00PM"
        Return '12:01:00'.

    - s - "12:01:00 AM"
        Return '00:01:00'.


Function Description :

    Complete the timeConversion function in the editor below. 
    It should return a new string representing the input time in 
    24 hour format.

    timeConversion has the following parameter(s):

    - string s: a time in 24 hour format


Returns :

    string: the time in 24 hour format



Input Format :
    A single string  that represents a time in -hour clock format 
    (i.e.:  or ).


Constraints :

    - All input times are valid


Sample Input 0 :
    07:05:45PM


Sample Output 0 :
    19:05:45
