# Python Practise problem 8 (10 points) - Rohan Das is a Fraud

"""
Rohan Das is a Fraudby nature

Rohan Das wrote a python frunction to print a multiplication table of given number 
and put one of the values (randomly generated) as wrong.
Rohan Das did this to fool his classmates and make them commit a mistake in a test.
You cannot tolerate this! 

So you decided to use your python skills to counter Rohan's actions by writing 
a python program that validates Rohan's table

Your function should be able to find out the wrong values in Rohan's table and expose Rohan Das as a 
fraud.

Note : Rohans' Function return a list of number like this:


Rohan Das's Function Input:
rohanMultiplication(6)

Rohan Das's Function return this Output:
[6, 12, 18, 26......, 60]


You have to write a function isCorrect(table, number) and return the index where rohan's function is wrong 
and print it to screen! if the table is correct, Your funtion returns None.
