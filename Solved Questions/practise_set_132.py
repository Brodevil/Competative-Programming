# Solution :


n = 0
n2 = 0

for i in range(0, int(input())):
    n, c = map(int, input().split())
    thegrid = list()

    for i in range(0, n):
        thegrid.append(input())
    
    n, c = map(int, input().split())
    subgrid = list()

    for i in range(0, n):
        subgrid.append(input())
    
    found = False

    for i in range(0, len(thegrid)):
        for j in range(0, len(subgrid)):
            if subgrid[j] in thegrid[i + j]:
                if (j == len(subgrid)-1):
