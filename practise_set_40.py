Merge the Tools!


Consider the following :
 - A string, s, of length n where s=c[0] c[1]...[n-1].
 - An integer, k, where k is a factor of n.


We can split s into n/k subsegments where each subsegment, , consists of a contiguous block of
characters in . Then, use each to create string such that:
The characters in are a subsequence of the characters in .
Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in
occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index in occurs at a previous index
in , then do not include the character in string .
Given and , print lines where each line denotes string .
