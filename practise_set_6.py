# Python practise problem 6 (Easy, 10 points) - Guess the number

"""
Guess the number :

Problem Statement:-
Generate a randome integer from a and b. You and your friend have to guess a number between tow number a and b and 
both are inputs taken from the user. Your friend is player 1 and plays first. He will have to keep choosing the number and 
your program must tell whether the number is greater than the number. You playteh same game and then the person with minimum number of trials wins!

Randomly generate a number after taking a and b taking input and don't show that number to the user.


Input:
Enter the value of a :
4
Enter the value of b :
13


Output:
Player 1:
Please guess the number between 4 and 13

5
Wrong! Guess a greater number again

8 
Wrong! Guess a greater number again


6 
Correct You tooked 3 trials to guess the number

Player 2:
Please guess the number between 4 and 13
.
.
.
Correct You tooked 7 trials to guess the number

>> Player 1 wins as He tooked 3 trials and
