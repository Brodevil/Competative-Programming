Grading Student | Problem Statement :

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:
 - Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
 - Any  less than  is a failing grade.


Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
    - If the difference between the  and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
    - If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.


Examples :

    - grade = 84 round to 85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)
    - grade = 29 do not round (result is less than 40)
    - grade = 57 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, 
write code to automate the rounding process.


Function Description :

    Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below.

    gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

    - int grades[n]: the grades before rounding


Returns :

    int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate


Input Format :

The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of students.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer, grades[i].


Constraints :

    - i < n < 60
    - 0 < grade[i] < 100



Sample Input 0 :
    4
    73
    67
    38
    33


Sample Output 0 :
    75
    67
    40
    33

Student 1 received a 73, and the next multiple of 5 from 73 is 73. Since 75-73 < 3, the student's grade is rounded to 75.
Student 2 received a 67, and the next multiple of 5 from 67 is 70. Since 70-67 = 3, the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 67.
Student 3 received a 38, and the next multiple of 5 from 38 is 40. Since 40-38 < 3, the student's grade will be rounded to 40.
Student 4 received a grade below 33, so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 33.
