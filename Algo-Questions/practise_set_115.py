# Solution :

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a = int(input()), list(map(int, input().split()))
    iterate = 0
    while a != sorted(a):
        condition = False
        for _ in range(n):
            if _ != n-1 and a[_] > a[_+1]:
                if condition:
                    condition = False
                    continue
                a[_], a[_+1] = a[_+1], a[_]
                condition = True
                iterate += 1
                print(a, _, a[_], a[_+1])

    print(iterate)
