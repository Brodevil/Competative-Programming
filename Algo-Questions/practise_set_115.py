# Solution :

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a = int(input()), list(map(int, input().split()))
    iterate = 0
    while a != sorted(a):
        CONDITION = False
        for _ in range(0, n, 2):
            if _ != n-1 and a[_] > a[_+1]:
                a[_], a[_+1] = a[_+1], a[_]
                CONDITION = True
                print(a, _, a[_], CONDITION)
        if CONDITION:
            iterate += 1

    print(iterate)
