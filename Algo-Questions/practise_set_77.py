# Solution :


# Complete the 'permutationEquation' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.
# The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY p as parameter.


def permutationEquation(p: list) -> list:
    # Write your code here
    return 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())

    p = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))

    result = permutationEquation(p)

    print(result)
