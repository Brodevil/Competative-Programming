# Solution :


def jumpingOnClouds(c: list, k: int) -> int:
    e = 100
    i = k % len(c)

    e -= c[i] * 2 + 1  # initial energy loss
    while i != 0:
        i = (i + k) % n
        e -= c[i] * 2 + 1

    return e


if __name__ == "__main__":
    nk = input().split()

    n = int(nk[0])

    k = int(nk[1])

    c = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))

    result = jumpingOnClouds(c, k)

    print(result)
