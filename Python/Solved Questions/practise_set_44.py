# Python practise 44 - Plus Minus (From hackerrank) = (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/plus-minus/problem)

"""
Plus Minus :


Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero.
Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.


Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. 
      The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, 
      though answers with absolute error of up to  are acceptable.



Example :

    >>> arr = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]

    There are n=5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. 
    Their ratios are 2/5 = 0.4000000, 2/5 = 0.4000000 and 1/5=0.2000000. 
    
    Results are printed as:
        0.400000
        0.400000
        0.200000


Function Description :
    Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below.

    plusMinus has the following parameter(s):

     - int arr[n]: an array of integers


Print :
    Print the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array.
    Each value should be printed on a separate line with 6 digits after the decimal.
    The function should not return a value.



Input Format :
    The first line contains an integer, n, the size of the array.
    The second line contains n space-separated integers that describe arr[n].


Constraints :
 - 0 < n < 100
 - -100 < arr[i] < 100



Output Format :

Print the following 3 lines, each to 6 decimals:

 1. proportion of positive values
 2. proportion of negative values
 3. proportion of zeros



Sample Input :

    STDIN           Function
    -----           --------
    6               arr[] size n = 6
    -4 3 -9 0 4 1   arr = [-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]


Sample Output :

    0.500000
    0.333333
    0.166667



Explanation :

There are 3 positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 1 zero in the array.
The proportions of occurrence are positive: 3/6 = 0.5000000, negative: 2/6 = 0.333333 and zeros: 1/6 = 0.166667.
