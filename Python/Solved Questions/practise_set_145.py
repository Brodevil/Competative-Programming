# Solution :


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = [0] * (n + 1)
    s = 0
    b = sorted([[a[i], i] for i in range(len(a))], reverse=True)
    pos = 1

    for k, i in b:
        res[i + 1] = pos
        s += 2 * k * abs(pos)
        if pos > 0:
            pos = -pos
        else:
            pos = -pos + 1

    print(s)
    print(*res)
