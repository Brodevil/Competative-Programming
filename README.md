# Python-practise
I suppose to solve few questions and do python practice 

- In this repo I just dump my sloved python problem as a practise
- Nothing special but every file contain the question as well as solution
- In repo all the file containing `code n error.py` file too had solved few problem which will a good practise for a programmer to read 
- This Python-practise repository was started at `18th of April 2021` from that period the practises are getting to be done
